# Laravel Starter Kit

Simple starter kit based on Laravel React Starter Kit but with new additions:

- Docker setup
- Makefile
- Team integration
- ULIDs as primary keys

# How to boot

Right now you cannot download it using `laravel new` I'm working on it, you can `git clone`
and then simply run `make docker-up` and `make docker-laravel-init` and you are good to go
